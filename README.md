# Fibonacci-Sequence

A Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each successive number is the sum of
the previous two. The classic Fibonacci begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,
377, ... . You are asked to use the while loop write a program that can compute the  ‚Äêth
Fibonacci sequence number, where n is a value input by the user. For example, if n = 0, then the
result is 0. If n = 6, then the result is 8.
